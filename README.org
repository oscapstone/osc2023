the checkbox checked and follow the [[./git-usage.org][guide]] to fetch your own branch.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Make good use of =.gitignore=. In the git history, we do not want to see
  binaries, objective files, __MACOSX, python caches, super large test files,
  or any files that can be compiled from your source code.
#+END_QUOTE

** Create a PR
Create a Github pull request before your demo. Once the PR is created, you can
always push additional commits to your forked repo before the PR is merged. The
changes will automatically appear within the PR.

1. Click the =New pull request= buttom in your repo.
   [[./images/pr_button.jpg]]
2. Choose the branch with your student ID as the base branch.

* Happy Coding ~
As long as you meet the above requirements and the PR can be merged without
conflicts, we do not care about what the forked repo look like. You can rename
your branch, change the default branch, or do whatever you want.
